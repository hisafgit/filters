This script has the function "filter_comb" that returns all possible values of a filter 
with "n" number of elements. 

Let us say n = 2 in filter_comb(n). 
In this case, the function returns  [(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)]. 
This is also evaluated as [(False,False), (True,False), (False,True), (True, True)].

The function could also be run with a list different from [0,1] and it will run in a similar fashion.
